# _data
Well-formatted site data SHOULD be placed here. The Jekyll engine will autoload all YAML files in this directory (using either the .yml, .yaml, .json, or .csv formats and extensions) and they will be accessible via `site.data`. If there's a file `members.yml` under the directory, then you can access contents of the file through `site.data.members`.
